# Slice String for GA4

GA4 has some limits for collecting string values as event parameters or user properties. This template can be used to slice and split the string data into multiple event parameters or user properties.

- Select the number of characters to extract, e.g. 100 for event parameters or 36 for user properties. 
- Input a string value.
- Select which part to extract, e.g. the part with the first 100 characters.
